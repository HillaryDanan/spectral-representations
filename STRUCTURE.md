# Repository Structure

This repository is organized to separate theoretical foundations from empirical work, with clear documentation of what is established versus hypothesis.

## Current Status

**Populated:**
- README.md ✓
- theory/core-framework.md ✓
- LICENSE ✓

**Planned:**
- All other directories to be populated as research progresses

## Principles

- **Theoretical focus**: Foundational investigation, not applied engineering
- **Scientific rigor**: Every claim either peer-reviewed or marked as hypothesis
- **Explicit uncertainty**: Clear about established vs. requires-testing
- **Falsification criteria**: Testable predictions throughout
- **Open collaboration**: Inviting critique and empirical validation

## File Naming Conventions

- Lowercase with hyphens (not underscores)
- Descriptive names (measurement-problem.md not mp.md)
- .md extension for all documents
- Organized by theme not chronology

## Companion Repository

This work is complementary to [Linguistic Dynamics Theory](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/linguistic-dynamics-theory), which formalizes the trajectory dynamics emerging from sequential wave collapse.

## Contributing

This is open theoretical work. Contributions welcome:
- Critical analysis (find flaws)
- Empirical testing (validate/falsify)
- Theoretical extensions (connect to other frameworks)
- Mathematical refinement (strengthen formalism)

Open issues to discuss or submit pull requests with improvements.

## Scientific Status

**Working hypothesis requiring empirical validation.** All claims appropriately caveated in documents. Built on established foundations from quantum mechanics, information theory, signal processing, and neuroscience.
